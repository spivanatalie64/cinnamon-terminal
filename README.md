## Why Cinnamon Terminal?

Cinnamon Terminal was the gold standard for Linux terminals for over two decades. But the GNOME project has been on a trajectory that leaves a lot of users behind:

### The problem with modern Cinnamon Terminal

The GNOME project has been systematically removing X11 support from their applications. They're going **Wayland-only**, which is fine for some, but X11 isn't dead — and Cinnamon Desktop primarily runs on X11. Rather than maintaining coexistence, GNOME is stripping out features and breaking workflows.

### GNOME Console (kgx) is not the answer

GNOME decided that Cinnamon Terminal was too complex, so they created **GNOME Console** (kgx) as a replacement. And honestly, it sucks:

- ❌ **No tabs** — a modern terminal without tabs in 2026
- ❌ **No profiles** — can't save configurations for different workflows
- ❌ **No transparency** — can't customize your terminal appearance
- ❌ **Minimal to a fault** — they removed everything that made terminals useful
- ❌ **No dropdown mode** — can't quick-launch from a keyboard shortcut
- ❌ **No custom shortcuts** — you get what you get

Console is a terminal for people who don't actually use terminals. It looks pretty in screenshots but is painful to work in daily.

### What Cinnamon Terminal does about it

Cinnamon Terminal is our answer. We're forking Cinnamon Terminal and we're:

- ✅ **Keeping the features** — tabs, profiles, transparency, the whole toolkit
- ✅ **Keeping X11 support** — for people who actually use their desktops
- ✅ **Optimizing for Cinnamon** — deep integration with the Cinnamon Desktop ecosystem
- ✅ **Adding Wayland when ready** — not breaking X11 to do it
- ✅ **Tracking upstream security fixes** — we maintain, not abandon
- ✅ **Making our own releases** — AcreetionOS releases with our patches

**Cinnamon Terminal is the terminal that GNOME abandoned. We're adopting it.**

> X11 forever, Wayland when ready, features always.

## Upstream Tracking

This fork tracks upstream [Cinnamon Terminal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal). We regularly rebase on upstream updates to pull in security fixes and improvements. Changes pushed upstream are never pushed back — this is a one-way fork with our own release cadence.

To see what's changed from upstream:

```bash
git log upstream/master..master
```

## Release Schedule & Governance

Cinnamon Terminal follows an **enterprise-grade release process** designed for stability. We don't break things because we feel like it — every release goes through a structured governance pipeline.

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Development** | ~10 weeks | Features land in `unstable`, upstream changes merged automatically |
| **Feature Freeze** | 1 week | Only bug fixes accepted, release branch created |
| **Hardening** | 2 weeks | Testing, validation, soak testing, multi-distro verification |
| **Release Day** | — | Tag, sign, publish, announce |
| **Post-Release** | Ongoing | Security monitoring, hotfixes as needed |

### Schedule

| Release | Target | Type |
|---------|--------|------|
| **25.06** | June 2026 | LTS (18 months support) |
| **25.09** | September 2026 | Standard (3 months support) |
| **25.12** | December 2026 | Standard |
| **26.03** | March 2027 | Standard |
| **26.06** | June 2027 | LTS (18 months support) |

> **LTS releases** receive security backports for 18 months.
> **Standard releases** are supported until the next release.

### Release Process

- Versioning: [CalVer](https://calver.org/) — `YY.MM.patch`
- All releases are signed tags
- Changelogs generated from structured commit history
- Release artifacts published on [GitLab Releases](https://gitlab.acreetionos.org/acreetionos-code/cinnamon-terminal/-/releases) and mirrored to all platforms

For detailed governance, see [RELEASE_SCHEDULE.md](https://gitlab.acreetionos.org/acreetionos-code/cinnamon-terminal/-/blob/master/docs/RELEASE_SCHEDULE.md).
